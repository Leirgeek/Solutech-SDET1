/**
 * Solutech SDET Challenge - Project Implementation Steps
 * Date: 2025-02-06
 * 
 * This file documents the major steps, commands, and challenges encountered during
 * the implementation of the e2e testing framework for the Booking Challenge project.
 */

/**
 * 1. Project Setup and Docker Configuration
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Initial setup of the development environment and Docker containers
 * 
 * Commands Used:
 * ```bash
 * # Build Docker containers
 * docker-compose build
 * 
 * # Start Docker containers
 * docker-compose up -d
 * 
 * # Configure application and database
 * docker exec -it booking-php-fpm chmod +x /setup/setup.sh
 * docker exec -it booking-php-fpm /setup/setup.sh
 * ```
 * 
 * Challenges:
 * - Container conflict with existing "booking-mailhog" container
 * - Resolution: Used docker-compose down to remove existing containers before starting new ones
 * 
 * Services Running:
 * - Web Application: http://localhost:8000
 * - MailHog: http://localhost:8001
 * - phpMyAdmin: http://localhost:8002
 */

/**
 * 2. E2E Testing Framework Setup
 * ---------------------------
 * Implementation of Cucumber and Playwright testing framework
 * 
 * Commands Used:
 * ```bash
 * # Install dependencies
 * npm install
 * 
 * # Install Playwright browsers
 * npx playwright install
 * ```
 * 
 * Key Files Created:
 * 1. Configuration Files:
 *    - playwright.config.ts: Playwright test configuration
 *    - cucumber.conf.js: Cucumber configuration
 *    - tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration
 * 
 * 2. Test Structure:
 *    - /features: Cucumber feature files
 *    - /step-definitions: Step implementation
 *    - /pages: Page Object Models
 *    - /tests: Playwright test specifications
 *    - /utils: Shared types and utilities
 */

/**
 * 3. Test Implementation
 * --------------------
 * Development of test scenarios and implementation
 * 
 * Features Implemented:
 * 1. Login Feature:
 *    - Valid/Invalid credentials testing
 *    - Form validation
 *    - Error handling
 * 
 * 2. Booking Feature:
 *    - Tour selection and booking
 *    - Form validation
 *    - Ticket generation and download
 * 
 * 3. Admin Feature:
 *    - Tour management
 *    - Booking management
 *    - Ticket management
 * 
 * Design Patterns Used:
 * - Page Object Model (POM)
 * - Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
 * - Data-driven testing
 */

/**
 * 4. CI/CD Integration
 * -----------------
 * Setup of GitHub Actions workflow
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * - Automated test execution on push/PR
 * - Browser installation
 * - Test reporting
 * 
 * File: .github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml
 */

/**
 * 5. Repository Setup and Push
 * -------------------------
 * Setting up and pushing to GitHub repository
 * 
 * Commands Used:
 * ```bash
 * git init
 * git remote add origin https://github.com/Leirgeek/Solutech-SDET1.git
 * git add .
 * git commit -m "Initial commit: Added e2e tests with Playwright and Cucumber"
 * git push -u origin main
 * ```
 */

/**
 * 6. Running Tests
 * -------------
 * Commands for executing tests:
 * 
 * ```bash
 * # Run all tests
 * npm run test:e2e
 * 
 * # Run Playwright tests
 * npm run test:playwright
 * 
 * # Run tests with UI mode
 * npm run test:playwright:ui
 * 
 * # Debug tests
 * npm run test:playwright:debug
 * ```
 */

/**
 * 7. Best Practices Implemented
 * --------------------------
 * 1. Code Organization:
 *    - Separate concerns (features, steps, page objects)
 *    - Reusable components and utilities
 *    - Type definitions for better maintainability
 * 
 * 2. Testing Practices:
 *    - Comprehensive error handling
 *    - Data-driven approach
 *    - Clear and descriptive test names
 *    - Proper setup and teardown
 * 
 * 3. Docker Best Practices:
 *    - Service isolation
 *    - Environment configuration
 *    - Volume management
 */

/**
 * 8. Known Issues and Solutions
 * --------------------------
 * 1. Docker Container Conflicts:
 *    - Issue: Existing containers preventing new setup
 *    - Solution: Use docker-compose down before starting new containers
 * 
 * 2. Path Resolution in Windows:
 *    - Issue: Path separators in Windows vs Docker
 *    - Solution: Use normalized paths in configuration
 * 
 * 3. Test Stability:
 *    - Issue: Flaky tests due to timing
 *    - Solution: Implemented proper wait strategies
 */

/**
 * 9. Future Improvements
 * -------------------
 * 1. Test Coverage:
 *    - Add more edge cases
 *    - Implement API testing
 *    - Add performance testing
 * 
 * 2. CI/CD:
 *    - Parallel test execution
 *    - Test result reporting
 *    - Environment-specific configurations
 * 
 * 3. Documentation:
 *    - API documentation
 *    - Test coverage reports
 *    - Setup guides for different environments
